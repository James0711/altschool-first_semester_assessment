        <h3>Student ID: ALT/SOE/023/2464</h3>
        <p>I am a Data Analyst and a Researcher. I hold a bachelors degree in Mathematics.

            <h2>Why AltSchool</h2>
            <p>
                AltSchool is one of the best and educative tech training school with quality hand-on experience in
                the tech industry. <br>Their vision to curtail technological challenges with practical problem solving skills
                by imparting their students with relevant skills to <br> standout in the tech world formed the basis of my interest
                in joining the institution.
            </p>
            <h2>My Projection at AltSchool</h2>
            <p>
                My goal is to successfully complete the <b>1 year AltSchool program</b> and emerge as a proficient
                <b>backend engineer</b>.
                This intensive program offers a comprehensive curriculum that covers key aspects of backend development,
                including databases, server-side programming, and system architecture. <br>
                Throughout this journey, I aspire to acquire a strong foundation in programming languages, gain hands-on
                experiences with relevant tools and technologies, and develop problem-solving skills. <br>
                By dedicating myself to learning and actively participating in the program, I aim to not only graduate
                but also excel in this field, positioning myself for a rewarding career as a backend engineer in 1 year.
